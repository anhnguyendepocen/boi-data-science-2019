# An aside: about the structure of these slides

- This slide deck was created using the R package [xaringan](https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#44) (/ʃæ.'riŋ.ɡæn/) and [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

- Some slides include hidden comments. To view them, press __p__ on your keyboard

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align='center'}

# Discussion forum

We will use a [GitHub discussion repository](https://github.com/ml4econ/discussion-spring2019). To use it, you'll need to create a GitHub account and ask for an invitations from Itamar.  

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align='center'}

Google and [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/) are typically the first places to look for answers for computational related questions. It is safe to always assume that you are not the first one to encounter your problem.

Nevertheless, we will also be using a private GitHub repository for class discussion. Please post there any questions or requests you may have that are relevant to all course participants, rather than emailing us. All of your classmates will benefit from the public discussions.

You can access our GitHub discussion repository [here](https://github.com/ml4econ/discussion-spring2019), but before you do, make sure that you have created a GitHub account (see instruction [here](https://ml4econ.github.io/course-spring2019/git.html)) and that you have received a collaboration invitations from me (Itamar). Shoot me an email if you haven't received an invitation.

.big[__About__]

Tools of trade: R, Tidyverse, Git...

How and when to apply ML methods

  - Generate good quality predictions
  - Classify data objects  
  - Organize unstructured data

To do that we will need to understand

  - what is ML?
  - How it relates to stuff we already know?
  - How it differs?

]

.pull-right[

.big[__Not about__]

- Cutting-edge ML techniques (e.g., deep learning)

- Computational aspects (e.g., gradient descent)

- Data wrangling (a.k.a. "feature engineering")

- Distributed file systems (e.g., Spark)

# Programming language


* Two of the most popular open-source programming languages for data science:  

  - [<i class="fab fa-r-project"></i>](https://www.r-project.org/)  
  
  - [<i class="fab fa-python"></i> Python](https://www.python.org/)  

* We choose R.  

* Why R? A matter of taste...

*  We do encourage you to try out Python. However, we will be able to provide limited support for Python users. 

* (Pro tip: You can use both! see the  [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) package.)
