# An Aside: About the Structure of These Slides

- This slide deck was created using the R package [xaringan](https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#44) (/ʃæ.'riŋ.ɡæn/) and [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

- Some slides include hidden comments. To view them, press __p__ on your keyboard

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("figs/comments.gif")

```

# Discussion Forum


- Google and [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/) are typically the first places to look for answers for computational related questions. It is safe to always assume that you are not the first one to encounter your problem.

- We will also use the BoI's "Success Factors" forum. Yael Dreyfus will provide more detaifls later.

.big[__About__]

Tools of trade: R, Tidyverse, Git...

How and when to apply ML methods

  - Generate good quality predictions
  - Classify data objects  
  - Organize unstructured data

To do that we will need to understand

  - what is ML?
  - How it relates to stuff we already know?
  - How it differs?

]

.pull-right[

.big[__Not about__]

- Cutting-edge ML techniques (e.g., deep learning)

- Computational aspects (e.g., gradient descent)

- Data wrangling (a.k.a. "feature engineering")

- Distributed file systems (e.g., Spark)

# Programming Language


* Two of the most popular open-source programming languages for data science:  

  - [<i class="fab fa-r-project"></i>](https://www.r-project.org/)  
  
  - [<i class="fab fa-python"></i> Python](https://www.python.org/)  

* We choose R.  

* Why R? A matter of taste...

*  We do encourage you to try out Python. However, we will be able to provide limited support for Python users. 

* (Pro tip: You can use both! see the  [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) package.)
